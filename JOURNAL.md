05/26: already have a lolin S3 mini for the microcontroller and i am actually searching for a rotary encoder and a way to make smooth while scrolling with some bearing , found one right there :Module encodeur rotatif SEN0235  . I'm also thinking about the size a scroll wheel of 2cm diameter would be perfect for the moment my printer is broken need to fix it asap ; 
For the base i will do a square of 4cm (I need to mesure my lolin) tommorow i will search for some bearing and do a bit of sketching before modeling 
05/29: today i meseured my lolin and did a sketch of the base of the project. since my rotary encoder is the same as my esp32 i will extruded an hole and put all the pieces at once. Next thing to do is to cad the scroll wheel.
